        <h2>Overview</h2>

        <p>Software development processes should consider the impact of its policies in the quality of the software
            product
            when designed. Factors like salary scales, promotion policies and recognition mechanisms have direct
            influence
            in the way software artifacts are produced, hence they have impact in its quality.</p>

        <p>An instance of this problem is observed in the bug reporting process, where testers are encouraged to
            increase
            the reported priority in order to maximize the number of fixes delivered. This situation — called Priority
            Inflation by practitioners — is analyzed using game theory. Game theory uses mathematical models to study
            conflict and cooperation, and and we use them in this paper to identify inflation causes and to propose a
            solution to this problem.</p>

        <p>We built a simulation model of bug reporting as a part of our empirical game-theoretic analysis, finding that
            what we call an <em>Unsupervised Prioritization</em> process it is not incentive compatible since at
            equilibrium
            the <em>Heurisitic Dishonest</em> strategy has a probability of 1.0. We also evaluated our proposed bug
            reporting process —based on inflation penalties and reporter reputation— finding that with only a 3%
            penalty factor we can move equilibrium towards a profile where the <em>euristic Honest</em> strategy has a
            probability of 1.0.</p>

        <h2>The Priority Inflation Problem</h2>
        <p>We designed a survey to assess the magnitude of the priority inflation problem. Through convenience
            sampling we were able to reach 152 software engineers, whose answers were collected using
            the Google Forms platform. </p>

        <h2>Game-Theoretic Process Improvement</h2>

        <p>The priority inflation game is played by <em>bug reporters</em>, who are in charge of discovering and
            reporting the bugs that are present on a specific version of a software system. When reporting a bug, the
            reporters are required to assign a <em>priority</em> label to a bug report, which is related to the urgency
            for a fix for this bug to be delivered.

            The bug reporter objective is to maximize its <em>reporter score</em>, which is a function of the bugs
            reported that got fixed and its ground-truth priority.</p>

        <p>Formal game-theoretic analysis faces tractability problems when dealing with interactions among several
            agents with a large number of strategies available to them. To address these issues, empirical
            game-theoretic analysis relies in game reduction techniques and simulation to allow a rigorous analysis. The
            empirical game-theoretic approach used in this project is described in the diagram above.</p>

        <h3>Simulating Bug Reporting</h3>


        <span class="image fit"><img src="images/input_output_transformation.png"

        <p>The pay-off function of a bug
            reporter
            playing the Priority Inflation
            Game depends on the number of reported bugs that got fixed as well as its ground-truth priority. Pay-off
            calculation is critical for equilibrium analysis as we need the pay-off value for each player on each
            strategy profile. We will rely on a simulation model —illustrated above—of the bug reporting process
            for obtaining the number
            of bug reports fixed per player per strategy profile.</p>

        <h2>New Mechanisms for Bug Reporting</h2>

        <p>After defining the internals of our empirical game, we
            perform the equilibrium analysis of three bug reporting processes: Two of them are taken from existing
            practices in the industry and one is proposed by the authors.</p>

        <h3>The Unsupervised Prioritization Mechanism</h3>

        <p><span class="image left"><img src="images/up_diagram.png"
                                         alt="Unsupervised Prioritization"/></span>What we call a <em>unsupervised
            prioritization process</em> is a reporting process where one team has assigned the bug reporting and bug
            prioritization responsibilities while a different one is in charge of bug fixing.

            <br/>

            By applying the procedure described before, we have found an equilibrium in
            pure strategies were the probability of the <em>Heuristic Dishonest</em> strategy is 1.0 and 0.0 for the
            other 6 strategies in our catalog. The dominance analysis indicates that this is an equilibrium on dominant
            strategies.

        </p>

        <h3>A Gatekeeper-Based Reporting process</h3>

        <p><span class="image right"><img src="images/gk_diagram.png"
                                          alt="Unsupervised Prioritization"/></span>In a <em>gatekeeper-based
            process</em>, the bug reporting and bug prioritization responsibilities are assigned to different teams.

            <br/>

            The first gatekeeper configuration explored considers that gatekeepers can detect 90% of mislabeled
            priorities: The equilibrium profile obtained through the process described previously
            has a probability of 1.0 for the <em>Empirical Inflator</em> strategy while 0.0 for the other 6
            strategies.
        </p>

        <h3>A Throttling Mechanism</h3>

        <p><span class="image left"><img src="images/tr_diagram.png"
                                         alt="Throttling Mechanism"/></span>We propose a
            mechanism — which we call the <em>throttling bug reporting process</em> — that maintains the
            decentralized prioritization attribute of unsupervised prioritization Reporting but incorporates a priority
            assessment phase like in a gatekeeper-based process:

        </p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>The bug fixing team evaluates the bug prioritization task:</strong> After developing a patch,
                the
                developer also assigns a priority label to the bug report, that might differ to the one assigned by the
                bug
                reporting team.
            </li>

            <li><strong>Bug reporting team members have assigned a reputation value:</strong> On the throttling bug
                reporting
                process we assume that the developers have a fair understanding of the bug priority after developing its
                corresponding patch. When a developer identifies a bug report with a priority label that differs from
                his
                assessment, he will penalize the offender by diminishing his reputation value.
            </li>

            <li><strong>Bug fixing activities also depend on the reporter's reputation:</strong> For a bug to be fixed
                or
                delayed is not only a function of the priority label on the report, now it also depends on the
                reputation
                value of the reporter that placed the report.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p>

            When we applied a penalty of 3% in case of dishonesty, the number of equilibrium is only one where
            the <em>Heuristic Honest</em> strategy has a probability of 1.0. We obtained the same result when the
            penalty value was set to 5%.

        </p>
