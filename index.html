        <h2>Overview</h2>

        <p>Software development processes should consider the impact of its policies in the quality of the software
            product
            when designed. Factors like salary scales, promotion policies and recognition mechanisms have direct
            influence
            in the way software artifacts are produced, hence they have impact in its quality.</p>

        <p>An instance of this problem is observed in the bug reporting process, where testers are encouraged to
            increase
            the reported priority in order to maximize the number of fixes delivered. This situation — called Priority
            Inflation by practitioners — is analyzed using game theory. Game theory uses mathematical models to study
            conflict and cooperation, and and we use them in this paper to identify inflation causes and to propose a
            solution to this problem.</p>

        <p>We built a simulation model of bug reporting as a part of our empirical game-theoretic analysis, finding that
            what we call an <em>Unsupervised Prioritization</em> process it is not incentive compatible since at
            equilibrium
            the <em>Heurisitic Dishonest</em> strategy has a probability of 1.0. We also evaluated our proposed bug
            reporting process —based on inflation penalties and reporter reputation— finding that with only a 3%
            penalty factor we can move equilibrium towards a profile where the <em>euristic Honest</em> strategy has a
            probability of 1.0.</p>

        <h2>The Priority Inflation Problem</h2>
        <p>We designed a survey to assess the magnitude of the priority inflation problem. Through convenience
            sampling we were able to reach 152 software engineers, whose answers were collected using
            the Google Forms platform. </p>

        <h2>Game-Theoretic Process Improvement</h2>

        <p>The priority inflation game is played by <em>bug reporters</em>, who are in charge of discovering and
            reporting the bugs that are present on a specific version of a software system. When reporting a bug, the
            reporters are required to assign a <em>priority</em> label to a bug report, which is related to the urgency
            for a fix for this bug to be delivered.

            The bug reporter objective is to maximize its <em>reporter score</em>, which is a function of the bugs
            reported that got fixed and its ground-truth priority.</p>

        <p>Formal game-theoretic analysis faces tractability problems when dealing with interactions among several
            agents with a large number of strategies available to them. To address these issues, empirical
            game-theoretic analysis relies in game reduction techniques and simulation to allow a rigorous analysis. The
            empirical game-theoretic approach used in this project is described in the following diagram.</p>

                                     alt="Empirical Game-Theoretic Analysis"/></span>

        <p>The pay-off function of a bug reporter playing the Priority Inflation
            Game depends on the number of reported bugs that got fixed as well as its ground-truth priority. Pay-off
            calculation is critical for equilibrium analysis as we need the pay-off value for each player on each
            strategy profile. We will rely on a simulation model of the bug reporting process for obtaining the number
            of bug reports fixed per player per strategy profile.</p>
