        <h2>Overview</h2>

        <p>Software development processes should consider the impact of its policies in the quality of the software
            product
            when designed. Factors like salary scales, promotion policies and recognition mechanisms have direct
            influence
            in the way software artifacts are produced, hence they have impact in its quality.</p>

        <p>An instance of this problem is observed in the bug reporting process, where testers are encouraged to
            increase
            the reported priority in order to maximize the number of fixes delivered. This situation — called Priority
            Inflation by practitioners — is analyzed using game theory. Game theory uses mathematical models to study
            conflict and cooperation, and we use them in this paper to identify inflation causes and to propose a
            solution to this problem.</p>

        <p>We built a simulation model of bug reporting as a part of our empirical game-theoretic analysis, finding that
            prioritization processes from industry are is not incentive compatible since at
            equilibrium the <em>Dishonest</em> strategy has a positive probability. We also evaluated our proposed bug
            reporting process —based on inflation penalties and reporter reputation— finding that with only a 20%
            penalty factor we can move equilibrium towards a profile where the <em>Honest</em> strategy has a
            probability of 1.0.</p>

        <h2>The Priority Inflation Problem</h2>
        <p>We designed a survey to assess the magnitude of the priority inflation problem. Through convenience
            sampling we were able to reach 152 software engineers, whose answers were collected using
            the Google Forms platform. </p>

        <h2>Modelling Software Processes as Games</h2>


        <span class="image fit"><img src="images/empirical_game_theory.png"
                                     alt="Empirical Game-Theoretic Analysis"/></span>


        <p>The priority inflation game is played by <em>bug reporters</em>, who are in charge of discovering and
            reporting the bugs that are present on a specific version of a software system. When reporting a bug, the
            reporters are required to assign a <em>priority</em> label to a bug report, which is related to the urgency
            for a fix for this bug to be delivered.</p>

        <p>Formal game-theoretic analysis faces tractability problems when dealing with interactions among several
            agents with a large number of strategies available to them. To address these issues, empirical
            game-theoretic analysis relies in game reduction techniques and simulation to allow a rigorous analysis. The
            empirical game-theoretic approach used in this project is described in the diagram above.</p>


        <p>The pay-off function of a bug
            reporter
            depends on the number of reported bugs that got fixed as well as its reported priority. Pay-off
            calculation is critical for equilibrium analysis as we need the pay-off value for each player on each
            strategy profile. We rely on a simulation model of the bug reporting process
            for obtaining the number
            of bug reports fixed per player per strategy profile.</p>

        <h2>Diagnosing Current Practice</h2>

        <span class="image fit"><img src="images/mechanism_figure.png"
                                     alt="Bug prioritization Processes"/></span>


        <p>After defining the internals of our empirical game, we
            perform the equilibrium analysis of bug prioritization processes adopted in industry.</p>

        <h3>Distributed Bug Prioritization</h3>

        <p>Is a reporting process where one engineer has assigned the bug reporting and bug prioritization responsibilities
            while a different one is in charge of bug fixing.
            In the figure above, it is represented by the blue components.
            By applying the procedure described before, we have found an equilibrium in
            pure strategies were the probability of the <em>Dishonest</em> strategy is 1.0 and 0.0 for the
            other strategies in our catalog.
        </p>

        <h3>Gatekeeper Process</h3>

        <p>In a <em>gatekeeper process</em>, the bug reporting and bug prioritization responsibilities are assigned to
            different teams.
            In the figure above, it is represented by the blue and red components.
            The first gatekeeper configuration explored considers that gatekeepers can detect 50% of mislabeled
            priorities: The equilibrium profile obtained through the process described previously
            has a probability of 1.0 for the <em>Dishonest</em> strategy while 0.0 for the other 6
            strategies.
            The same result was obtained with a detection rate of 90%.
            An ideal gatekeeper with perfect detection rate produce multiple equilibria.
        </p>





        <hr class="major"/>

        <h2>The Assessor-Throttling Process</h2>


        <p>We propose a process — that we call the <em>assessor-throttling</em> — that maintains the
            decentralized prioritization attribute of unsupervised prioritization but incorporates a priority
            assessment phase like in a gatekeeper process:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>The bug fixing team evaluates the bug prioritization:</strong> After developing a patch,
                the
                developer also assigns a priority label to the bug report, that might differ to the one assigned by the
                bug
                reporting team.
            </li>

            <li><strong>Bug reporters have assigned a reputation value:</strong> In assessor-throttling we assume that
                the developers have a fair understanding of the bug priority after developing its
                corresponding patch. When a developer identifies a bug report with a priority label that differs from
                his
                assessment, he penalizes the offender by diminishing his reputation value.
            </li>

            <li><strong>Bug fixing depends on the reporter's reputation:</strong> For a bug to be fixed
                or
                delayed is not only a function of its priority label, in assessor-throttling it also depends on the
                reputation of the reporter.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            In the figure above, assessor-throttling is represented by the blue and green components.
            When we applied a dishonesty penalty of 20%, the number of equilibrium is only one where
            the <em>Honest</em> strategy has a probability of 1.0. We obtained the same result when the
            penalty value was set to 22%.

        </p>

        <p>As
            part of this project we built a software
            tool to support the teams that adopt assessor-throttling, since according to our analysis is the best option
            to address Priority Inflation. Our tool —
            called <em>TheFed</em> — is a Chrome extension for supporting teams that are using JIRA as
            their bug tracking system.</p>
